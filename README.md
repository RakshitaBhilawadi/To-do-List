# To-do-List
This is a simple, yet fully functional To-Do List application built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.
It allows users to add new tasks, mark existing tasks as complete, and delete tasks. Crucially, it utilizes the browser's Local Storage to save all your tasks, meaning your list persists even if you close and reopen the browser.
# Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new items using the input field and "Add" button.
Mark as Complete: Click on a task to toggle its completion status (indicated by a checkmark and line-through text).
Delete Tasks: Remove completed or unwanted tasks by clicking the delete/close button .
Persistence: Tasks are automatically saved using Local Storage and remain visible when you refresh the page or close the browser.
